TAINT is a php-ext used to detect XSS codes(tainted string).
The idea is from https://wiki.php.net/rfc/taint, I implemented it in a php extension which make the patch no-needed.

Please note that do not enable this extension in product env.

Works with PHP-5.2.6 ~ PHP-5.3.10, will fix the 5.4 compile issues soon.
